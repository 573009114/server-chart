-------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: Due to security concerns and configuration variability, terminating TLS exclusively on an external load balancer is being deprecated. The "tls=external" option will be removed in future versions of the Helm chart.

See https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/ha/helm-rancher/chart-options/#external-tls-termination for details of this change and converting to TLS on the Ingress.
